PARK_MY_VEHICLE

Motivation: 

              Having a car can be convenient, but finding a parking slot can be a pain in the neck for both the driver and the society. Few years ago one driver spent 20 minutes finding an empty slot to park his vehicle. This project helps the driver to find areas where parking is available in that area. 

                There are a few websites/applications which provide a similar platform. We have tried to make our website specifically simple so that any normal person can access and manage the website with ease. Our system provides very user-friendly work. 




	

Objective & Goals: 

⮚ Main goal is that customers can park their vehicle in a safe zone, because of their website customers do not have to wait to park their vehicle anywhere which causes irrelevant traffic in that area. 
⮚ We save customers time to park their vehicle by providing them with the current status of parking if their slot is empty or not , so they don't have to wait in a queue. 
⮚ Easy to book slot due to user-friendly interface. 
⮚ Customers can easily search and book the slot online at the lowest price. 
⮚ Maintaining details of customer payment, details and also updating the same is easier. 
⮚ Capable of storing day-to-day transactions. 
⮚ Since all the data is stored in the database, analysis of data can be done. Every data can be accessed and analysis can be done which will help in generation of reports for future use. 

Project Scope : 
1.	Utilize the parking area proficiently. 
2.	Reducing time to search the free parking spaces. 
3.	This project will be highly used in busiest cities like Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Delhi etc. 
4.	The global smart parking market size is expected to grow from USD 24,329.6 million in 2020 to USD 95,059.9 million by 2027. 
5.	If all slots are full, users have to wait for undefined time 
6.	Reservation System
7.	Payment Processing: The website can allow users to pay for parking online, reducing the need for cash transactions and increasing revenue collection. 
8.	Real-Time Parking Availability: 
9.	Reporting and Analytic
10.	Customer Support: The website can provide users with access to customer support, including FAQs, chatbots, and phone support. 


Limitations: 

1.	Hardware Limitations 
2.	Network Limitations
3.	Data Accuracy 
4.	User Adoption
5.	Security Risks 


FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

    Parking systems are likely to become more automated, connected, and sustainable in the future. Here are some trends that may shape the future of parking systems:

•	Smart parking
Uses sensors to detect available spaces and mobile apps to guide drivers to the nearest spot. Smart parking systems can also optimize space, reduce time spent finding parking, and enhance operational efficiency.
•	Autonomous vehicles
Can park themselves and communicate with parking management systems to optimize parking usage.
•	Contactless and mobile payments
Mobile apps allow users to pay for parking seamlessly, eliminating the need for physical tickets or cash.
•	Machine learning models
Can learn from patterns of usage, enabling parking facilities to dynamically adjust pricing and availability based on demand.
•	Integration with other smart city technologies
Can help create a more seamless and efficient urban mobility experience.
